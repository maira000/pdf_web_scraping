# pdf_web_scraping
PDF Data Extraction using Scraping API:
Utilize a PDF scraping API (e.g., DocParser, Tabula, or similar) to extract structured data from PDF files.
Integrate the PDF scraping API into your Python script.
Handle cases where the PDF structure may vary or where additional data cleaning is required.

Web Scraping for Additional Data:
Perform web scraping to gather complementary information related to the extracted PDF data.
Use a Python web scraping library such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy.
Ensure that web scraping is conducted ethically and respects the website's terms of service.

Data Transformation:
Combine the extracted PDF data and the web-scraped data into a unified, structured format suitable for storage in a database.

Database API Interaction:
Use a database API (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, or MongoDB) to interact with the database.
Create a table or collection to store the transformed data.

API Endpoint for Data Storage:
Implement an API endpoint to receive data from the script and store it in the database.
The API should accept data in a format that matches the transformed data structure.
Make a download button to download data in excel file.

Error Handling and Logging:
Implement proper error handling to manage issues during PDF scraping, web scraping, data transformation, and API interactions.
Utilize logging to capture relevant information for debugging and monitoring.

Deliverables:
A Python script that accomplishes PDF and web data extraction, transformation, and database integration.
Documentation explaining how to run the script, including any required dependencies.
A simple API documentation specifying the endpoint for data storage.
